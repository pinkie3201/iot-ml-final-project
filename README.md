2) One deep learning model
Then publish insights in a Tableau Public dashboard.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` raw and processed data
- `notebooks/` exploration, cleaning, modeling
- `src/` reusable python scripts
- `dashboard/` files exported for Tableau
- `docs/` report assets + system design diagram

## How to run
